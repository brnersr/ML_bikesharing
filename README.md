# 🚴‍♂️ Bike-Sharing System - ML Predictions

This project predicts bike-sharing demand using machine learning techniques, utilizing the [Seoul Bike Sharing Demand dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/560/seoul+bike+sharing+demand). The goal is to forecast bike demand at different times of the day to optimize bike distribution and improve operational efficiency. The project covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building a predictive model using machine learning algorithms in Python.

## Dataset Features:
- Weather data
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Seasonal patterns

These features are used to train the model for accurate demand forecasting.
