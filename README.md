## Bike-Sharing System - ML Predictions

This project predicts bike-sharing demand using machine learning techniques, utilizing the Seoul Bike Sharing Demand dataset. The goal is to forecast bike demand at different times of the day to optimize bike distribution and improve operational efficiency. The project covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building a predictive model using machine learning algorithms in Python.

Key features of the dataset include weather data, temperature, humidity, and seasonal patterns, which are used to train the model for accurate demand forecasting.
